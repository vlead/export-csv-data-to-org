# Readme file for running exporter.py

This script converts data in xslx format to org format.

To run the script execute it as follows:


$ python <exporter.py path> <lab path>

This will generate the org files in the same folder where xslx is located for the lab.
This also generates testreport per lab and metafiles per experiment.
